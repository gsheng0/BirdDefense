## General info
Bird Defense is a 2 day hackathon project made using only Java 8 and its basic packages.
Collaborated with two friends.

## Game info
Players start with a nest in the center of a map

Towers (or 'birds') can be placed anywhere on the map
* Towers, with the exception of one of them, fire projectiles in the general direction of enemies
* Projectiles disappear if they collide with an enemy or move off screen
* Towers always target the closest enemy

Enemies (or 'bats') slowly spawn at the edges of the map
* Enemies always attack the nearest tower
* If there are no towers within its vision, it heads towards the nest
* Enemies grant the player money on death
* Spawn rate ramps up over time

Controls
* Drag and drop towers from the side bar
* When dragging, a circle will appear signifying the range of attack that tower has
* Towers can be placed anywher on the map
